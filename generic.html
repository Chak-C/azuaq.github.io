								<p> Alvis is a third and final year student pursuing a bachelors degree in Applied Data Analytics. He has an innate passion with statistics and analysis since 
									high school but	his perceptions and interests in the field of data has been a relatively recent development, blooming during the midpoint of his second year 
									in university after acquiring his first intern experience as a software developer in Sandstone Technology. During the internship, he realized the applicability 
									of programming with data and quickly found joy in 'playing' with small datasets using different code languages. Since then, Alvis exhibits higher levels of 
									engagement for self-improvement through learning new concepts through various sources and applying the knowledge personally.
									     </p>
								<p> A pivotal point in Alvis' journey was his recent second intern experience as a document migration specialist in Doxadvisors. While Alvis demonstrated 
									conscientiousness in his work and maintained high standards for all tasks, he lacked the necessary experiences in collaboration and self-reflection to achieve 
									his full potential. Doxadvisors noticed it and provided significant feedback, guidance and necessary support Alvis needed to step out of his comfort zone and 
									polish himself. He thoroughly processed the feedback and suggestions and derived a series of incremental changes to ensure continuous progression. Months later, 
									by the end of the internship, Alvis was well equipped with the skills for self-improvement and exhibits behaviours fit for collaborative tasks in different roles.
								</p>
								<p> Nevertheless, Alvis' journey in data and analytics is still in progress. During his leisure time, when he steps away from his monitor and desk (and his bed), he finds 
									inner peace in aimless street wandering, indulging in shadowboxing, and even the simple act of grocery shopping. </p>
